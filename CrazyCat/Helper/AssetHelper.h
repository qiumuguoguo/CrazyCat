 by "-ipad" before the filename extension. On iPhone/iPod Touch it will simply return the given filename, so the overhead is minimal
 while the iPad has enough power to cope with modifying a resource strings on the fly. */

 By naming all corresponding iPad assets with the "-ipad" suffix and using this function you can avoid a lot of #ifdef and load different
